    <h2 id="main_header">What is a Chief?</h2>

    <p class="firstp">On April 1, 1893 the Navy issues-
    Navy General Order 409 of 25 February, 1893 which establishes the rate of
    <strong>Chief Petty Officer</strong>.  Starting as the seventh enlisted rank in the U.S. Navy, a
    Chief Petty Officer only becomes a Chief after time in service, superior evaluation scores, 
    as well as specialty examinations with in their respective rates (Job).  Thereafter only when, he or she is reviewed by a 
    selection board of serving<em> Senior</em> and<em> Master Chief Petty Officers</em> can they actually advance.    
    </p>

    <p class="secondp">Shortly after the First Class Petty Officer is advanced he/she still has to be put through what is called initiation. Now formally 
    called "indoctrination", the<span> Chief Select</span> (as they are called) is 
    made to endure a period of instruction and mentoring by his or her cognizant Chief's Mess. 
    The selectee is assigned a sponsor who supervises the selectee's indoctrination. 
    A "charge book", decorated in the manner the Sponsor advises, is presented by the selectee for signature to 
    every Chief, Senior Chief, and Master Chief in the local area. These Chiefs would provide written tasks, ask questions, 
    or provide guidance to the selectee.  The charge book would be taken into evidence at the end of the indoctrination period. 
    The indoctrination period would culminate with a ceremony known as Initiation.  Advancement into the Chief Petty Officer grade 
    within the enlisted naval ranks is the most significant promotion for a First Class Petty Officer.</p>

    <h3>What is his or her purpose?</h3>

    <p>At the rank of Chief, the First Class Petty Officer 
    takes on more administrative duties.  CPO’s serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders, 
    with the emphasis being more on leadership as they progress through the CPO ranks. 
    One collateral duty for all Chiefs is to train Junior Officers. Like Petty Officers, every 
    Chief has both a rank and rating <span>(job, similar to an MOS in other branches)</span>. A Chief's full title is a combination of the two.
    Thus, a Chief Petty Officer who has the rating of Builder would properly be called a Builder Chief (BUC).
    </p>

    <p>The CPO uniform also changes to reflect this change of duty, becoming identical to that of an officer's uniform except with 
    different insignia. Officers and Chiefs are often colloquially referred to as "khakis", as both wear khaki-colored uniforms.
    Nonetheless it’s one of the proudest days in an enlisted individual's naval service, in which a First Class Petty officer dons the Chief 
    uniform and is accepted into the Chief Petty Officer community.
